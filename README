scofl: Secret of Chrono Ogre Final Lagoon

This code is designed to generate story and game content, ultimately it will
attempt to generate something like one of the classic JRPGs (hence the title).
This project involves several interoperating pieces:

  - The arc generator: generates small story arcs involving a few characters
    over a short period of time.
  - The arc assembler: Specifies what kind of arcs to construct and then weaves
    generated arcs together to create a larger story.
  - ... some more stuff, I'm sure.
